The `config-typescript` folder holds specific typescript config files for the monorepo. Based on [Vercel's tailwind turborepo example](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/tree/main/examples/with-tailwind/packages/config-typescript).

`base.json` is the foundational configuration that can be extended by project specific configs.

`nextjs.json` extends `base.json` and provides targeted configuration for next.js projects.
