## react-pdf

Using react-pdf renderer to generate pdfs. Note that it is different from react-pdf which is used to display existing pdfs.

### react-pdf bookmark bug

```
 {...{ bookmark: schemaSectionContent.value }} // NOTE: Spread bookmark as a Typescript bug workaround. See: https://github.com/diegomura/react-pdf/issues/1979
```

### Fonts

Fonts must be registered before they can be used. See: https://github.com/diegomura/react-pdf/issues/1075

### How PDF is generated

1. `<DynamicPDF />` used in page conditionally so it only renders after form submitted

```
  {isSubmitted ? (
    <PDFViewer style={pdfStyles.pdfViewer}>
      <DynamicPDF formData={formData} />
    </PDFViewer>
  ) : null}
```

2. `<DynamicPDF />` uses `buildPDF()` to generate pdf based on user's formData and pre-defined schema
3. `buildPDF()` uses `createTemplateSchema()` to generate a document template schema and then uses `renderFullPDF()` to render the template using `react-pdf`'s components.
4. `renderFullPDF()` maps through the schema. Each object it maps is considered a section. It then uses `renderPDFElements()` to render the components in each section.
5. `renderPDFElements()` matches the component type based on the schema and renders the correct component.

Side Notes:

- `createTemplateSchema()` uses `filterSubSchemas()` to return the pre-defined location and generic schemas
- `filterSubSchemas()` returns the correct schema based on the location field in `formData`
- `pdfStyles` holds all the styles used in the pdf
