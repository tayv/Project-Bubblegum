# FormSection Card

- A wrapper for the Card component. Enforces props needed to provide consistent UX inside `Form`
- A custom data attribute called "active" is added to detect which section is considered active. This allows targeting all the sections in the form so that the stepper functionality will work. It also updates styling using tailwind: e.g. `data-[attributeName]:text-slate-500`

## Gotchas

- Custom data attributes must be in all lowercase to avoid this react error:
  ```
  React does not recognize the `dataActive` prop on a DOM element. If you intentionally want it to appear in the DOM as a custom attribute, spell it as lowercase `dataactive` instead. If you accidentally passed it from a parent component, remove it from the DOM element.
  ```
